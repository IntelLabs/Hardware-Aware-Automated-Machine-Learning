# Hardware-Aware Automated Machine Learning Research

This repository contains instructions and examples for efficient neural architecture discovery and optimization solutions developed at Intel Labs. 

### [EZNAS: Evolving Zero-Cost Proxies For Neural Architecture Scoring](./EZNAS/README.md) 

EZNAS is a genetic programming-driven methodology for automatically discovering Zero-Cost Neural Architecture Scoring Metrics (ZC-NASMs).

### [NNCF's BootstrapNAS - Notebooks and Examples](./BootstrapNAS/README.md) 

BootstrapNAS automates the generation of weight-sharing super-networks using the Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF).
